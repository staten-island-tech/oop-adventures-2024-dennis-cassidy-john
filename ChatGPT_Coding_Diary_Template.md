## Project Name: OOP Adventures

### Date: _[Insert date]_

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**

Briefly describe the problem you're trying to solve or the task you're working on.

Example:
> I need to create a heal function for my class

---

## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**

Describe the initial approach you took to solving the problem. If you started writing code, include it here.

```python
def heal(self, water_bottle):
        self.health + water_bottle
        print(f"{self.player} healed {100}. Health is now {self.health}.")
```

- What was your plan for solving the problem?
My plan was to try add the health to the water bottle and print how much the player healed

- Did you have any initial thoughts or strategies before using ChatGPT?
Other than trial and error, no
---

## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT
Write down the questions or requests you made to ChatGPT. 
Also include what code from ChatGPT you are unsure of and craft a question that asks for further clarification.

```text
- "How do I reverse create a heal function for my Player class?"
- "Can you suggest a more efficient way to create this function?"
- "How do I make it so that the health counter doesn't go over 100?"
```

---

## 4. **ChatGPT's Suggestions/Code Changes**

Record the code or suggestions ChatGPT provided. Include any changes or improvements ChatGPT suggested and how it influenced your approach.

```python
def heal(self, water_bottle=100):
        self.health += water_bottle
        if self.health > self.max_health:
            self.health = self.max_health
        print(f"{self.player} healed {water_bottle} points! Health is now {self.health}/{self.max_health}.")
```

- What was ChatGPT's solution or suggestion?
ChatGPT created a code that had didn't have syntax errors and also made the health counter max at 100 health.

- How did it differ from your original approach?
It differed because it added things to the code to make it make sense.

## 5. **Reflection on Changes**

Reflect on the changes made to your code after ChatGPT's suggestions. Answer the following questions:

- Why do you think ChatGPT's suggestions are helpful or relevant?
It created a function that worked

- Did the suggestions improve your code? How?
A lot because it went from a code that couldn't run at all to working perfectly.

- Did you understand why the changes were made, or are you still uncertain about some parts?
I understand

Example:
> ChatGPT recommended using a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort. I think this will improve the runtime for large inputs, but I need to review the algorithm's complexity to fully understand its advantages.

---

## 6. **Testing and Results**

After making the changes, did you test your code? What were the results?

- Did you run any tests (e.g., unit tests, edge cases)?
Yes
- Did the code work as expected after incorporating ChatGPT's changes?
Yes

```python
# Example: Testing the updated sorting function
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1]
print(optimized_sort(numbers))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 5, 9]
```

- Did you encounter any bugs or issues during testing?
No
---#Example code usage
player = Player(player = "Omar", health=100)
print(player)

player.heal(100)

## 7. **What Did You Learn?**

In this section, reflect on what you learned from this coding session. Did you gain any new insights, or were there areas you still struggled with? 
I realized that my logic in coding isn't so good, and it is 1 step to improving it as I keep seeing new strategies to code, such as more complex booleans.
